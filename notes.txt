use xor

key whitening = use keys before and after encryption algorithm
    - plaintext > xor (w/key) > encryption > xor (w/key) > ciphertext
    - like painting over a fence with white, the fence is still visible after the first coat
        - after many coats, (key whitens) the fence (key) becomes less visible
